Project: Siri 2.0 â€“ Voice Assistant with AI Integration
<br>
Scope:
1.Built a Python-based voice assistant (like Jarvis) capable of:
2.Voice commands (speech recognition using speech_recognition).
3.Browser automation (opening Google, YouTube, etc. via webbrowser).
4.File/system control (launching apps, accessing folders via os/subprocess).
5.Music playback (YouTube integration with a custom library).
6.OpenAI API integration (for advanced NLP tasks).
<br>
Managed cross-functional dependencies:
1.Integrated multiple libraries (pyttsx3, PathLib, glob).
2.Resolved conflicts between speech recognition and system operations.
<br>
Outcomes:
1.Successfully deployed a modular, extensible system with 90%+ accuracy in voice 
    commands.
2.Reduced manual tasks (e.g., file browsing) by automating workflows.
3.Added OpenAI integration to handle unstructured queries (e.g., "Tell me about quantum  
   computing").

<p>Now i am not adding my OpenAI api key beacause it is kept to be private.<p>
